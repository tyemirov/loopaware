# Notes

## Rules of engagement

Review the NOTES.md. Make a plan for autonomously fixing every item under Features, BugFixes, Improvements, Maintenance. Ensure no regressions. Ensure adding tests. Lean into integration tests. Fix every issue. Document the changes.

Fix issues one by one. 
1. Create a new git branch with descriptive name
2. Describe an issue through tests. Ensure that the tests are comprehensive and failing to begin with.
3. Fix the issue
4. Rerun the tests
5. Repeat 2-4 untill the issue is fixed and comprehensive tests are passing
6. Write a nice comprehensive commit message AFTER EACH issue is fixed and tested and covered with tests. 

Do not work on all issues at once. Work at one issue at a time sequntially. 

7. Remove an issue from the NOTES.md after the issue is fixed: New and existing tests are passing without regressions
8. Commit the changes and push to the remote.

Leave Features, BugFixes, Improvements, Maintenance sections empty when all fixes are implemented but don't delete the sections themselves.

## Issues

## Features

## Improvements

- [ ] [LA-11] Remove all routes that are unused by the front-end/widget.js. It looks like we have two ways of communicating with the server, one through the API and one through the front end UI. There must be only front UI left (and whatever is requried to serve the widget)
- [ ] [LA-12] The avatar route is probably unnessary, we can just replace the image if we have it in the template file rather than having a special rout to serve it
