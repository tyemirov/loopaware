- [ ] internal/httpapi/public_assets.go — extract shared header, theme script, and style assets for public pages to keep theme selection consistent.

- [ ] internal/httpapi/templates/landing.tmpl, internal/httpapi/templates/privacy.tmpl — embed shared header markup, data attributes, and scripts so both pages respect stored theme.
- [ ] internal/httpapi/landing_test.go, internal/httpapi/privacy_test.go — extend coverage for header reuse and theme persistence across landing and privacy.
