- [x] internal/httpapi/headless_browser_test_helpers.go — replace the chromedp-only launcher with a reusable go-rod harness that downloads Chromium when needed, manages lifecycles, and exposes screenshot capture plus viewport utilities.
- [x] internal/httpapi/widget_integration_test.go — migrate actions to the shared rod harness so widget flows execute reliably, keep screenshot variance analysis, and assert artifact paths under `tests/<date>/<testname>/`.
- [x] internal/httpapi/dashboard_integration_test.go — reuse the rod harness for session-timeout scenarios, capture light/dark prompt screenshots, and ensure navigation assertions run instead of skipping.
- [x] README.md, MIGRATION.md — document the rod-based integration test prerequisites and explain where screenshot artifacts are stored.
