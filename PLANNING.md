# Planning

This document captures product planning themes and release framing for LoopAware. It is not a process playbook.

## Planning inputs
- Customer feedback and support reports.
- issues.md/ISSUES.md backlog.
- PRD.md, README.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md constraints.

## Release themes
- Auth reliability and first-click sign-in UX.
- Widget embedding, origin controls, and autosave UX.
- Subscription flows and delivery reliability.
- Traffic analytics accuracy and performance.

## Rolling milestones
- M1 Auth stability: reduce sign-in retries and logout regressions.
- M2 Widget quality: embed targets, autosave edits, and per-widget origin controls.
- M3 Subscriber and traffic UX: export polish, test coverage, and stats clarity.

## Validation expectations
- Each milestone lands with integration coverage for primary user flows.
