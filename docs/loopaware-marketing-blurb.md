LoopAware is mprlab’s lightweight feedback platform for production sites: an embeddable widget captures customer comments in real time, while Google-backed sign-in and a role-aware dashboard give your team a secure, centralized place to manage sites, messages, and engagement. Built on a simple, SQLite-first backend, LoopAware is easy to deploy, privacy-conscious, and designed to fit neatly into existing stacks.
