## Improvements (210–299)

- [ ] [LA-214] Add additional source origins UX to the subscriber widget ![alt text](image.png). Add an extra source origin section before the "Place this snippet on pages where you want visitors to subscribe." have + and - buttons to add input fields with extra allowed source origins.
- [ ] [LA-215] Improve instructions for the subscribe widget. copying the script probably won't be sufficient, so we shall have two pieces:
  1. <script defer src="http://localhost:8080/subscribe.js?site_id=12665b6e-78a2-421f-9149-04be800f6245"></script>
  2. The form that actually displays the subscribe fields

## BugFixes (312–399)
- [ ] [LS-317] the menu label “Built by Marco Polo Research Lab” is invisible. Consult the examples in @tools/mpr-ui/demo and be sure not to override any of the mpr-ui css with our own css ![alt text](<../image copy 2.png>)
- [ ] [LS-318] the site starts in the light switch toogle on the left which shall be light theme but it displays dark theme. FIx it and make the toggle on the left be light theme and the toggle on the right be dark theme ![alt text](<../image copy 2.png>)
