## [Unreleased]

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Role-aware dashboard with Google authentication via TAuth.
- Feedback widget and public feedback collection endpoint with strict per-site origin validation.
- Subscription widget with double opt-in confirmation flow, unsubscribe flow, and CSV export.
- Traffic pixel with visit and unique visitor metrics, top pages, trend, attribution, and engagement analytics.
- Real-time server-sent events for feedback and favicon refresh updates.
- Multi-origin site configuration support for widget, subscription, and traffic collection.

### Changed
- Release automation now publishes GitHub Pages and Docker images only on pushed version tags matching `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

### Fixed
- Top-pages aggregation now merges trailing-slash and non-trailing-slash paths and normalizes all-slash paths to `/`.
- Visit trend aggregation now normalizes SQL day keys to avoid dropping counts for timestamp-like day values.
- WhatsApp in-app browser traffic is no longer misclassified as bot traffic.
- Widget API origin resolution now falls back to HTTPS-aware behavior in proxy deployments that omit `X-Forwarded-Proto`.
